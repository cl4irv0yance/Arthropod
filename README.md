# Arthropod

A  tool used to test basic network segmentation. 
------------------------------------------------

This is a simple script that runs through FPING and a simple NMAP script for common ports. 

It can be edited to suit any needs. 

------------------------------------------------

<h1> Usage </h1>

All you need to do is enter in a subnet like the following:

<code> ./arthropod.sh 192.168.1 </code>

The tool will do the rest once you select what you want. 


------------------------------------------------

<h1> Note </h1>

Currently, using any other character outside of the menu options will allow you to run both fping & nmap together.
